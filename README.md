# What is Live ScreenSaver?
Live ScreenSaver is a screensaver made by PikaDude (me) that displays live webcams from across the world.
# Requires .Net Framework 4.6.1
Otherwise it probably won't work... Download it here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=49981
# How do I install it?
Download the installer below here and then it pretty much tells you what to do.

# How do I configure it?
Go to your "Screen Saver" settings on Windows and there should be a configure button. (At the moment there is nothing to configure so don't bother)
# Installer returns some weird error
I know this sounds extremely suspicious, but you NEED to run it as administrator. The installer has to move the screensaver into a folder where Windows can find it, hence, the Admin Perms.
# I found a bug
Report it in the issues section. Thats why it exists
# I found a really cool webcam that I want to be added
Once I have created a config menu, you can add it to your list. But if you think its really good, add it in the Issues section with the tag "Enhancement" or something.
# No Pics No Clicks

That enough evidence that I'm not trying to scam you?
